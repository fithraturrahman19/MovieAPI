Task Case Study: Movie API

===Note===

1. The tech stack used are .NET Core 5, C#, MySQL
2. The DB is prepraed through MySQL queries, the queries used are included in this repository
3. The theme of the app is Movie API endpoints
4. I utilized visual studio Swagger API template to showcase the API endpoints
5. I did not make unit testing, not many functions except the SQL connection and API processing itself

Thank you very much.
